				<h2>Our Mission</h2>
				<p>
					The most common complaints you hear when someone talks about any
					construction company is narrowed down to three things:
				</p>

				<p id='missionBulletA'>A) Lack of communication.</p>

				<p id='missionBulletB'>B) Quality of work.</p>

				<p id='missionBulletC'>
					C) Not doing what they say they are going to do, in writing or verbal.
				</p>

				<p>
					Our company is based on honesty and integrity. With those two words,
					we aim to change the way people view the construction industry. We are
					set out to bring integrity back to the electrical construction trade
					by highlighting the three negatives listed above and focus on a
					customer satisfaction driven initiative.
